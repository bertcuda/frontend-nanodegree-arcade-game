#Bugs, Bugs, Bugs!

This is a simple game modeled after the classic arcade game Frogger. The object of the game is for the player to cross a multiple-lane road to reach _home_ (a "cozy" rock), while avoiding stepping on bugs and trying not to fall into the water.

#Getting Started

Git users can clone the game at [frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game](https://github.com/bertcuda/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game) into a folder on your personal computer. Alternatively, download the bugs.zip file at [frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game](https://github.com/bertcuda/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/bugs.zip), and unzip it into your folder. After cloning or unzipping, navigate into the `frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game` folder and open `index.html` in your browser to run the game.

#How To Play

The game starts in _Idle_ mode. Press the `Space` key and use the up and down arrow keys to select your character. Then press the `Space` key again to start the game.

Use the arrow keys to move up towards home ("cozy" rocks), avoiding bugs along the way. Get home as many times as you can before time runs out and avoid falling into the water!

#Scoring

* Safe step: 10 points
* Stepping on a bug: 0 points, lose 2 seconds
* Arriving home: 50 points + 1 point per unused second
